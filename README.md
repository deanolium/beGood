A web based task tracker for resolution type things

This project is mainly done as a way to play around with React, Redux and Firebase integration. 
The rough plan is to first create the web app, and then follow this up with a mobile app (iOs is most likely) which alerts the user to the tasks and reveals the 'rewards'.

### Basic Features
 * CRUD tasks which are set on certain days of the week
 * Display the tasks to do on the current day
 * Mark tasks as done
 * Recur tasks each week
 * Undone tasks are highlighted on following days
 * Set rewards for completing tasks (completing perfectly for a day, a week, a month)
 * Display reward if criteria is met
 * Allow tasks to be set for more particularly days, such as first X, or fortnightly
